the delphic oracle for this God was no doubt a place called "Milwaukee"
since it will be there that they will find where most of the icons to this

While reading a textbook of chemistry, I came upon the statement 'nitric
acid acts upon copper,' and I determined to see what this meant. Having
located some nitric acid, I had only to learn what the words 'act upon'
meant. In the interest of knowledge, I was even willing to sacrifice one of
the few copper cents then in my possession. I put one of them on the table,
opened a bottle labeled 'nitric acid,' poured some of the liquid on the
copper, and prepared to make an observaction. But what was this wonderful
thing which I beheld? The cent was already changed, and it was no small
change either. A greenish-blue liquid foamed and fumed over the cent and
over the table. The air became colored dark red. How could I stop this? I
tried by picking the cent up and throwing it out the window. I learned
another fact: nitric acid acts upon fingers. The pain led to another
unpremeditated experiment. I drew my fingers across my trousers and
discovered nitric acid acts upon trousers. That was the most impressive
experiment I have ever performed. I tell of it even now with interest. It
was a revelation to me. Plainly the only way to learn about such remarkable
kinds of action is to see the results, to experiment, to work in the
laboratory.
