=====================================

Time to resurrect my old Humorscope
site, in the form of a react/redux page
that uses thing-a-day to retrieve
random stuff.

What I'll try:

css grid
react
redux
thing-a-day
ES6
mongodb

The site itself will have 12 randomly
selected predictions per day, a daily
quote, and a daily thing to be grateful
for (or maybe a daily lifehack?)

Let's see how incremental we can make
this?
